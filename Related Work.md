### Common issues in the "Related Work" section of a research paper.

* For multiple citations, it is better to separate them with a comma inside a single opening and closing bracket.
	- E.g. Previous studies [3,6,8] have taken a statistical approach...

* A space must exist before and after a citation. The ~ symbol is used in LaTeX to add a space.
	- E.g. (LaTeX code) Some studies~/cite{c1,c2}~focused on...

* Using author names or system/method names in your related work depends on the emphasis you want to make.

* If you want to make a stronger emphasis on the authors of a certain work (or they don't really have a name for their method), then you mention their names.
	- E.g. Brin and Page proposed a method [4] that...

* If you want to make a stronger emphasis on the method itself, then mention the method names.
	- E.g. The PageRank algorithm [4] suggests that...

* The way you write your related work should be organized hierarchically, and grouped in the following way if possible:
	- 1. Group by research topic
	- 2. Group by approach
	- 3. Group by date (from oldest to newest)

* The following terms should not always be used interchangeably, and care must be taken when using them. They are listed from most specific to most general.
	- 1. Algorithm
	- 2. Method/Technique (interchangeable)
	- 3. Framework/Methodology (interchangeable)
	- 4. Direction/Approach (interchangeable)
	- 5. Paper
	- 6. Study/Work (interchangeable)

* The word "researches" is not the plural of the noun "research", it is the present tense conjugation of the verb "to research" in the third person, singular.

* You can either describe the drawback (or limitation) of each work after briefly introducing it, or summarize all the drawbacks altogether at the end of your related work, and then explain how your work will overcome/deal with them.

* When writing the related work, make sure you use the past tense when referring to the authors having done something.
	- E.g. Mihalcea et al. devised an algorithm that can...

* When referring to the methods themselves, don't use the past tense, but rather the present tense, since the methods will always perform that verb.
	- E.g. Nguyen proposed a method, MetaOrganizer, which sorts database entries and categorizes them into... (the verb performed by the author is in the past tense, while the verbs performed by the method are in the present tense).
