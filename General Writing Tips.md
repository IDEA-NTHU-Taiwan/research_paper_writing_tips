### IDEA Lab Senior Meeting Notes (04/19/2013)

* Synopsis
	- In today’s meeting we had a guest speaker, Sean, who is a business and text analyst. He has come here to help senior students with writing papers – tips, suggestions, and strategies.

* Strategies
	- Read your text out loud and listen how it sounds.
 	- Count the number of breaths you have while you read out loud.
	- Make sure final readers only have to read each paragraph once and understand it.
	- Write short, concise sentences (be courteous to the readers).
		- If the sentence is too long, then break it up into two or more shorter sentences.
	- Brainstorm before writing a paragraph:
		- First think of the main idea/point/topic of the paragraph and write it down.
		- Write down a bulleted list of all the arguments to support that idea.
		- This will become the foundation of your final paragraph.
	- If you are not able to elevate your language (use different, more complicated words), then it is better to keep sentences short and simple.
	- Each paragraph and each point has to lead to the next (each contiguous paragraph has to be related).
	- Read your thesis to somebody who has a basic understanding of the subject matter.
	- Get the readers’ attention in your writing.

### Points of advice: (04/02/2013)
* Any terminology used should remain constant.
	- e.g. if the term "Dimension" is used it should not be changed to "Characteristics" later on.
* When describing related work, if there are different terminologies used for the same concept in the various papers, choose one terminology when describing all papers. Only in cases a unique term is mentioned in paper it can be used and cited.

* The flow of your paper should not cause the reader to jump to different parts of the paper unnecessarily. For example the use of the terms "Former" and "Latter" should be used with great care and should refer to items within the same paragraph. Where possible it is advised to not use these terms.

* Although keeping paragraphs short is important, they should not be vague, they should be concise. Any new term used must be explained.
	- e.g "We employed the B-Tech method", B-Tech needs to be explained

* Ensure your last statement from one paragraph links to the next paragraph

* Thesis Statement - a statement that describes the purpose of your research. It states the issue you want to solve

* The thesis statement should be repeated throughout the paper, however it should be done in a manner that focuses on the section it is repeated in.

* Title: the purpose of the title is to create a boundary.  One method of creating a title:
	- Create a list of keywords pertaining to research
 	- Change them as necessary to narrow the scope
	- Create at usable title with the keywords selected

* Purpose of paper sections:
	- Abstract -> summary of introduction
	- Introduction -> summary of methodology
	- Methodology -> shows your viewpoint -> should contain problem definition and/or thesis statement -> if too large can be broken in to sub sections before the methodology, which may be called Overview
	- Experiment -> review problem definition once more-> show how you solved it.
	- Conclusion -> summaries results-> shows how good they are -> this is the contribution of paper

* Avoid using phrases like "we are the first to do this research" or "we are the only ones doing such research", unless you are absolutely sure that your idea is novel.

* Terms such as "doesn't or does not" should not be used. They may be regarded as rude. It is recommended that you uses a more modest language.
	- e.g. instead of using "does not" use "unable to" 

* Do not use a citation as a noun, it should only be used as a reference.

* In related work when citing papers the citation should be close to the approach.
	- e.g. “Many papers [5,8,9]  mention ......."
